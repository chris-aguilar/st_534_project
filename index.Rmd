# Introduction

This data represents the average annual sunspot count. It is modified to date ranges 1850-2024, and focuses only on the average annual count and the date. This modification from the raw data was done as the raw data contains yearly counts, and 1850 is when 365 sunspot observations per year begin. Prior to that, the number was more variable, less than 365 observations per year, and often missing.
