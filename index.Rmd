# Introduction

This data ('aviation_incident_data_clean.csv') represents the quarterly aircraft incident count for all 50 US states going back to Q1 1983. This data was selected because claims were made that aviation incidents had become more common after January 2025, so we wanted to see if 2025 quarterly data followed a trend consistent with trends seen in previous years.
