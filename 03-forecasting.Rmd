# Forecasting

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

## A section

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.

```{r forecasting data import, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(fpp3)

# data import template for forecasting section; this code is set to not show in 
# report

sunspot_data <- read_csv("avg_annual_sunspots.csv") |>
  select(year, avg_sunspots) |>
  as_tsibble(index=year)

```
